"""
Short first-person affirmations for the narrated audio track.

Deliberately separate content from the four-part narrative shown in the
storyboard image: the audio is meant to be heard, not a read-aloud
duplicate of what's already on screen, so it uses entirely different
wording -- present-tense, first-person, affirmation-style, rather than the
narrative's second-person CURRENT REALITY / REFRAME / DESIRED FUTURE /
NEXT STEP structure.

Deterministic and template-based, not model-generated, for the same reason
NarrativeGenerator falls back to a deterministic template: predictable,
safety-reviewable output with no hallucination risk, and no extra model to
load just for a few short sentences. Never promises a guaranteed outcome,
consistent with generator.py's banned-phrase list.
