"""
Cognitive distortion detection: spaCy for linguistic parsing (negation,
lemmatization, sentence splitting) + our own hand-written rule set on top.

This is OUR engineering, not a pretrained model. It is intentionally a
simple, explainable rule set rather than a classifier: it needs to be
defensible sentence-by-sentence in the viva, and the space of clearly
worded distortion cues is small enough that rules generalize reasonably
well for a first version.

Five distortions covered in Phase 1: all-or-nothing thinking, fortune
telling, self-labeling, catastrophizing, overgeneralization. Phase 2 adds
ten more (mind reading, mental filter, disqualifying the positive,
magnification/minimization, emotional reasoning, should statements,
personalization, blaming, comparison, control fallacy), drawn from the
standard CBT distortion taxonomy (Burns, D. D. (1980). Feeling Good: The
New Mood Therapy. William Morrow.), for 15 total.
